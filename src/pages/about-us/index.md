  We recognise that at times clients need external resource, and require
  experienced individuals or teams to bridge a gap in expertise, provide
  augmentation to meet the changing demands of the business and to enable an
  agile response to the market. That's what Sparkybit does best.

  We have a culture of supporting our members to develop their skills and to
  harness their individual interests and creativity. We do this by providing an
