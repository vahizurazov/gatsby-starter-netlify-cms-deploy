section_2_left_text: >-
  Creating a bespoke software solution has many benefits, the most obvious one
  being you end up with a solution which is entirely tailored to your needs. You
  will not be paying for unnecessary functionality or annual subscription fees
  and being at the behest of the supplier to provide enhancements or bug fixes.
section_3_title: TECHNOLOGIES
section_3_text: >-
  Delivery of bespoke solutions requires technologies to be chosen carefully.
  Our expertise and experience allows us to identify and select technologies
  that will support and enhance your business objectives.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
