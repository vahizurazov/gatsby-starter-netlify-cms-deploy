### Initial Setup

Setting up your Salesforce application for the first time can be daunting. We assist clients in the initial design thinking of what they want the application to deliver to the business. Based on the design we will provide an implementation plan to illustrate what will be installed, what resources are required and how long it might take â€“ this allows our clients to plan for and manage the implementation process successfully from within.

### Integration

Integrating your Salesforce solution with other applications is necessary in order to realise the potential and benefit that this solution may bring. We are experts at API development to integrate with other platforms such as ERP and CRM, among others.

### Further Development

Our experts are able to further enhance your Salesforce solution by creating tailored features, unique to your business, to optimise the outcome. Low level Apex and Lightning Enterprise application development, for example, are some of the expertise we are able to provide.
